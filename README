You need to run the install as root!
The install script needs at least once access to /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas for the settings file 
(this will change in the future)

(first) Install command:
sudo install-all

For next installs or updates you can install as user
command:
install-all

You can also manually install as root for /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
and install the plugins as user
